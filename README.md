# 2013 Christmas Card

To look at [the past year's posts](http://www.milesrauschfamily.com/2013/), you might think nothing happened in 2013. 2013 was a maintenance release for us: no new kids, no new jobs, no new dwellings. So what *did* happen this year?

For our Christmas Card this year, we welcome you to take a look at the numbers. We present a digital presentation to highlight the most important digits in 2013.
